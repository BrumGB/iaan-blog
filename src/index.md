Obsessed with the internet since childhood I’ve pursued a career in web development which equipped me with over 8 years of commercial experience working with clients such as Xbox.com, NHS Partnerships, The Lancet and much more.

I love helping people achieve what they want on the internet, be it building new experiences, fixing pre-existing websites or enhancing what is already there. 

The services that I can provide are:

* WordPress Development
* Shopify Development
* Technical SEO (Google page speed improvements etc)
* Website maintenance & bug fixing
* Analytics
* Project scoping and architecture
* Accessibility reviews based on WCAG guidelines. (A, AA and AAA)
* Accessibility enhancements

And more...
